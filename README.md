# GPVAE for Latent Dynamics from Pixels in 3 Dimensional Video

Derived from similar work in 2d images in paper:
[Gaussian Process Prior VAE for Latent Dynamics from Pixels](https://github.com/scrambledpie/scrambledpie.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/Pics/GPVAE/AABI2019_paper.pdf)
Written in Tensorflow 1.13, python 3.6.
## Data
3D trajectory of 30 points (x,y,z) generated by GP and each point is converted to ball of radius 2
## Result
### Reconstruction of trajetcory on some samples not used in training
#### Result1:  16x16x16 samples and there reconstruction
